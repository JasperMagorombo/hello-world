# hello-world

Hello future Jasper,

Damn son how does it feel having a six-figure job right now?????
Enjoy that your hard work got you that so you can enjoy a little, go out tonight and meet a girl you bum.
But don't lose focus guy stay on your grind, people will want what you got stay on their necks!!!
Let me tell you something thats gonna make you laugh, as of right now 10:00am on 6/22/17 you broke as a joke.
In your capitol one 360 checings there is exactly $0.
You owe Westfield $1,5000.
And you have no plans for school or the future other than blind optimism and a new found sense of hard work

You maintained and perseveried my guy and for that I'm proud, but like I said don't ever lose sight.
Jerry came and lit the spark, but it up to you to keep the fire going that was never supposed to burn.
Ight then its time for me to bounce get back to your girl cause all I'm doing is watching the NBA draft tonight.
